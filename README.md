# nbarya-temperature-challenge-terraformrepo

## Infrastructure as Code for Temperature Unit Conversion problem

### Synopsis

    - Single click deployment pipeline is created for both frontend and terraform.
    - All underlying GCP infrastructure is created with Terraform - Cloud Build, Cloud Run, Google Bucket, Load Balancer, Network Endpoint Group.

Application endpoint (external facing - publicly available): http://34.160.97.48

## Development prioritization in near future:

    1. Implementation and Integration of logs, monitoring alerts - use of CloudMonitoring, Datadog, ELK.

    2. Implementation of Authentication based User access in the Cloud Run to make it more secure.

    3. Make Terraform workspaces for commonly used components for reusability of code.

    4. Improve the CI pipeline of terraform to make it more reliable.

    5. Enable CI/CD to have multiple environments like Lates, Stage, Load, Prod

    6. Integrate and use artifact repo for code artifacts - to enable faster recovery/restore

    7. Proper versioning of code, docker images, terraform

    8. Depending on application requirement, implementation of DR


## Usage

### Create

1. Create a branch and PR with proper changes
2. Review the terraform plan output generated by Github actions PR workflow
3. Gain approval for the PR.
4. Merging the PR to master will trigger the Github actions workflow to deploy the code in GCP.
5. If successful, merge and delete the branch.

### Destroy

1. Invoke the trigger manually from the Github Actions tab.
2. Enter the required directory and run the workflow.
3. Github actions destroy workflow will cleanup the Infra from GCP.
4. If successful, merge and delete the branch.
